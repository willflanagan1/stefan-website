        <h3>Bio: </h3>
        <p>
            I am an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. I am pursuing a degree in Biomedical Engineering
            <br> and a minor in Chemistry. I am interested in finding an internship for Summer 2020. I would like to apply my skills in STEM, 
            <br> Engineering, or programming to an experience over my break. I am both an American and Dutch citizen. As a result, I can work 
            <br> in either Europe or the US.

                    I am applying skills in SQL, HTML, and CSS to construct a database for the instituteI conducted research on Saphenous Vein Stripping 
                    <br> to develop a more efficient medical device for the surgery. I also programmed Graphviz to create a heat map for my supervisors 
                    <br> to track the institute's investments in the UNC Hospital. I interact with clients to improve their experience in working with the institute.

                    I am assisting in the development of a medical device that provides vibrational feedback to correct a patient’s gait. I use Solidworks
                    <br> and 3D printing to design and manufacture the exterior casing of the device. Consult my supervisor on plausible designs that 
                    <br> incorporate the electronics into a wearable product
